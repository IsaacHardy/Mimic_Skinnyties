#Skinny Ties

####In this project, I was given a webpage image and was asked to mimic the image to the pixel. 

####Throughout this project, I was challenged to solve postioning, sizing, and formating issues. I first decided to divide the page into specfic sections that I placed into numerous <DIV>. After the inital sub-sectioning of the page, I decided to tackle each section individually; first creating divisions within the section, and then styling those sections to meet the original image.

####Each section brought new challenges that taught me the significance of great positioning, meaningful sizing, and clean working code.
